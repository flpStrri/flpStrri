- Python, Python, some TypeScript, 🐍, and a little more of Python;
- Micro-services deployed on AWS ECS or AWS Lambda;
- Asynchronous messaging for inter-service communication using AWS SNS, SQS, and Kinesis Data Streams;
- DynamoDB or Aurora PostgreSQL with pgpool-II middleware persistence layer;
- Infrastructure as code using either Terraform or Serverless Framework;
- Automated CI & CD pipelines using TravisCI or Github Actions;
- CloudWatch, X-Ray, and OpenTelemetry;

João also burns some midnight oil to write — in Portuguese — at [**ReZÉnha**](https://rezenha.ze.delivery), [**Medium**](https://medium.com/@flpStrri), and — in English — at [**Substack**](https://serverlesseng.substack.com).

We are here for a future with more cheers. 🍻
