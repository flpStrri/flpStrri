For the past eight years, I have been employed by AB InBev's direct-to-consumer corporate ventures. This gave me the opportunity to participate in many of its venture's life-cycle events:
- Making technology decisions for new ventures.
- Optimizing and scaling businesses.
- Integrating successful business leaders back into AB InBev.

As a founding team member of ZÃ© Delivery, I've contributed to what culminated in the successful management of the load during the soccer World Cup 2022 marketing campaign. These accomplishments exemplify our commitment and proficiency in the dynamic domain of direct-to-consumer services.
