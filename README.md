I work at [Zé Delivery](https://ze.delivery), Brazil's largest beverage delivery service, as staff software engineer creating software to ease the way people enjoy their moments together. 🍻

My current activities includes architecting, developing, and deploying highly available workloads on AWS with:
* Python, Python, some TS, 🐍, and a little more of Python;
* Event driven or low latency RESTFUL micro-services deployed on ECS Docker containers or AWS Lambda;
* Infrastructure as code using either Serverless Framework or Terraform or even both;
* Aurora PostgreSQL with pgpool-II middleware or DynamoDB persistence layer;
* CloudWatch, X-Ray and OpenTelemetry;
* Automated CI/CD pipelines using TravisCI or Github Actions;

I also burn some midnight oil to write — in Portuguese — at [**ReZÉnha**](https://rezenha.ze.delivery), and [**Medium**](https://medium.com/@flpStrri).
