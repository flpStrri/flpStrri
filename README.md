I work in a global disruptive growth group backed by one of the largest CPG companies in the world — Anheuser-Busch InBev — creating software to ease the way people enjoy their moments together. 🍻

My current activities involve architecting, developing, and deploying Python serverless applications on AWS with:
- Python, Python, 🐍, and a little more of Python;
- Either *Serverless Framework* or *Terraform* or even both, on AWS Lambda, exposing a GraphQL or REST endpoint;
- Aurora PostgreSQL with *pgpool-II* middleware or DynamoDB persistence layer;
- CloudWatch & X-Ray telemetry;
- Automated CI/CD pipelines using TravisCI and Github Actions to deliver a "Serverless Github Flow";

I also burn some midnight oil to write — in Portuguese — at [**Zé Delivery Blog**](https://enzenharia.ze.delivery), and [**Medium**](https://medium.com/@flpStrri)
